##### New features

* [#8](https://github.com/Tim55667757/PriceGenerator/issues/8) Added ability to separate candlesticks by some trends. It was implemented two additional keys: `--split-trend` and `--split-count`. These keys affect the appearance of the trend and the number of candles in each trend.
  * The `--split-trend` key shows trends movements, e.g. `--split-trend=/\-` means that generated candles has up trend at first part, next down trend and then no trend.
  * The `--split-count` key set count of candles of difference periods, e.g. `--split-count 5 10 15` means that generated candles has 3 trends with 5, 10 and 15 candles in chain.

  * Hull Moving Averages (5, 20),
  * Volume Weighted Moving Averages (5, 20),
  * Also, only "Max_close / Min_close / Trend line" is showing by default.

* save the generated prices to a Pandas DataFrame variable for further use in automation scripts;
* automatically calculate some statistical and probabilistic characteristics of the generated prices and save them in markdown format (example: `./media/index.html.md`);
* load the prices of real instruments according to the OHLCV-candlesticks model from the csv-file and carry out their statistical analysis;
  * draw a chart of generated or loaded real prices and save it in html-format (example: `./media/index.html`);
  * generated prices, a chart and some data on price behavior can be saved as a regular png-image (example: `./media/index.html.png`).
